Documentation
=============

main.js
-------

`initialize()` - Where program starts.

`loop()` - Main game/physics loop.

`randomSystem(min,max)` - Returns randomly generated system between min/max
number of Bodies.

`Body(radius,x,y,color,rotationSpeed)` - Constructs Body object
(star/planet/asteroid).

physics.js
----------

`radialCollisionCheck(a,b)` - Returns true if collides, false if doesn't.

`combine(a,b)` - Combines Bodies.

`getSemiMajorAxis(parent,child)` - Returns the semimajor axis of an orbit.

`getParentAndInfluencer(a,b)` - Checks and sets parent/influencer (next highest
influence besides parent) of Bodies.

render.js
---------

`resizeMap()` - Sizes and places minimap as needed. Run once at beginning.

`mapCenterDot()` - Draws lines/dot on minimap.

`redrawIdontLike()` - A redraw method I really hate because it should be simple
to use the canvas to do half of this and it just doesn't work that way.

`estimateScale()` - Estimates the proper scale to use on the minimap. Is broken
and shitty.
