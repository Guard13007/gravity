What is Gravity?
================

I know, it needs a better name.

It's a simple little 2D n-body gravitation simulation using mostly basic algebra because I do not know of any higher maths. Okay, that's not strictly true anymore. I am learning better maths, and they will be applied as I continue to learn.

A better question might be, what is it to become? Well, a game. I want to make a game with somewhat realistic physics (though this could be thrown out for fun at any time, in which case I will fork this into a more simulator version vs game version), ships you can build and customize and launch from a planet and go to orbit and land and do science-y stuff and mine the heck out of planets and basically do all this really cool stuff.

However, this is the first project I've ever done. Do not expect it to be all that good at anything. Or ever be finished. No, do expect it to be finished, and please poke me muchly to make me continue working on it.

Who am I?
---------

Well, I'm surprised you found this instead of me, but I am [Guard13007] [1], mostly known for my YouTube channel of gaming, mostly known for news videos about Kerbal Space Program updates or videos of Kerbal Space Program itself. I want to expand on this, but that's beside the point.

Who am I? I am the Wolf of All Trades, Master of None. Why do I give myself this title? Well, I love wolves, and try to do everything. You name it, if it's a creative endevour, I have tried it at one point (or am trying, or will try). The downside of this, I am not particularly good at anything, just coming up with ideas.

But hey, this idea is going well, I'll stick with it.

Features
--------

* n-body, 2D, as accurate as you tell it to be (timeStep controls accuracy)
* a finished basic collider (WIP: more advanced/varied/collider options)
* cheat-y pathing by "forgetting" to clear the canvas
* scale in and out, change the frame of reference (including rotation!)
* colors :P (WIP: images for things instead of just colors)
