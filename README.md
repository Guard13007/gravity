Quick-Start Stuff!
==================

(It seems not to work with the HTML preview anymore. The next link may or may not work. The way to be sure is to download the ZIP from above, extract everything, and double-click 'gravity.html' to start it.)

[Click here to play with it] [2]. I also suggest opening up the [Console] [3] reference to see what you can do with it right now. Known bugs are listed in the [todo.md] [4] file, along with a scrawled list of my to-be-done's.

What is Gravity?
================

Right now, it is a simple 2D n-body gravity simulator using mostly basic maths.

What I hope for it to be is a complex game based on somewhat realistic physics (gamey but based loosely on reality), with ships you can build and customize and launch from a planet or a station in orbit, go orbit other things, land on things, mine things, do science things. Basically, it's all things and stuff.

This is my first project, don't expect much. (Okay, that's not strictly true, but everything I've done before was broken batch files or not related to programming.) If you see this project hasn't been updated in a week, please [send me an email] [5] or annoy me in some other way to keep working at it!

Who am I?
---------

Well, I'm surprised you found this instead of me, but I am [Guard13007] [1], mostly known for my YouTube channel of gaming, mostly known for news videos about Kerbal Space Program updates or videos of Kerbal Space Program itself. I want to expand on this, but that's beside the point.

Who am I? I am the Wolf of All Trades, Master of None. Why do I give myself this title? Well, I try to do everything. You name it, if it's a creative endevour, I have tried it at one point (or am trying, or will try). The downside of this, I am not particularly good at anything, just coming up with ideas. (The wolf part is [a whole other story] [6].)

But hey, this idea is going well, I'll stick with it.

Features
--------

* n-body, 2D, as accurate as you tell it to be (timeStep controls accuracy)
* a finished basic collider (WIP: more advanced/varied/collider options)
* pathing, including an optional fading path
* scale in and out, change the frame of reference (including rotation!)
* colors :P (WIP: images for things instead of just colors)
* a slightly buggy console for screwing with stuff while it runs

Known Bugs: Check [todo.md] [4] for a list of known bugs, along with all the random ideas I've written down.
