What is gravity?
================

I know, it needs a better name. It's a simple little 2D n-body gravitation simulation using only basic algebra because I do not know of any higher maths.

A better question might be, what is it to become? Well, a game. I want to make a game with realistic* physics, ships you can build and customize and launch from a planet and go to orbit and land and do sciency stuff and mine the heck out of planets and basically do all this really cool stuff.

However, this is the first project I've ever done (*first project that has consistently worked, had graphics, and isn't buggy as heck). Do not expect it to be all that good at anything. Hell, the gravitational simulation isn't even right, and that's what I started with!

*Realistic as in, looks realistic, not as in actually realistic. I am well aware that the way my simulator works is not how gravity actually works. This is a game, not a simulator. Even though it is called a simulation...
