General ToDo
------------

Saving and loading simulations.
Make collider (combination of bounce, explode, and combine?).
Stats for average velocity between playerId and another Thing.
Stats for average absolute distance of playerId.
Stats for average distance between playerId and another Thing.
Stats for average absolute distance of playerId.
Graph for playerId relative distance and velocity to another Thing.
Image rendering (objects can be defined as an image).
Support for rotation of objects (after adding images).
Support for rotation of reference frame.
Make radius not dependent on mass (variable density).
Make debugOut and playerOut rely on hyperRender var?
Make it possible to add in an object with a certain orbit using v = sqrt(GM/r)
  G=gravitational force of parent on new object, M=mass of parent object, r=radius of orbit
Controllable object (with playerId).
Collider(s).

Optimizing
----------

Implement collision detection inside gravity function (but not what happens during a collision).
