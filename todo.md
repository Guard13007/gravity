General ToDo
------------

This is stuff I want to do sooner rather than later.

* Saving and loading simulations.
* Stats for average velocity between playerId and another Thing.
* Stats for average distance between playerId and another Thing.
* Graph for playerId relative distance and velocity to another Thing.
* Image rendering (objects can be defined as an image).
* Support for rotation of objects (after adding images).
* Support for rotation of reference frame.
* Make it possible to add in an object with a certain orbit using v = sqrt(GM/r)
  G=gravitational force of parent on new object, M=mass of parent object, r=radius of orbit
* Controllable object (with playerId).
* Collider(s).

Optimizing
----------

These will not happen for a long time basically.

* Implement collision detection inside gravity function (but not what happens during a collision).
* Take as many config things as possible and just choose one option.
