Changelist 0.1.0

Since I will have "versions" for no good reason. Version numbering is "Major.Minor.Bugfix"
There won't be a version 1.0.0 for a veeeerrrrryyy long time.

- Removed "realistic" system because it was pointless.
- Fixed parent rotation. Added rotation (currently pointless).
- Added pseudo-3D display. Will make better when I learn trig.
- Made the README more ridiculous. :)
- Zoom in slowly function added for no particular reason.
